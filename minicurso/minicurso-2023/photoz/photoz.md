[EMENTA EM CONSTRUÇÃO] 


## Topic: Photometric Redshifts 

### Part 1 - beginner level 

1. Basic concepts 
2. Retrieve training data from astroquery
3. Cross-match with DES-DR2
4. Train with ~5 machine learning methods from scikit learn (point estimates)  
5. Validate (cross validation) against specz and choose a ML method (point estimate metrics)
6. Apply pz estimate method to a photometric catalog from DR2 
7. Compare N(z) with train data
8. Discuss train data representativity and limitations  

## Part 2 - intermediate level

1. Present template fitting methods
2. Filter transmission curves, SED templates, priors
3. Run LePhare and BPZ (original codes)
4. Compare results with ML methods
5. Discuss pros and cons of both groups ML x TF   

## Part 3 - advanced level

1. Intro - point estimates X PZ PDF 
2. State of the art PZ algorithms, catalog-based X image-based codes 
3. PDF representations 
4. PDF-based validation metrics 
5. PZ estimates on big data - parallelization
